# Lesson Screen Navigation Setup

## Overview
The LessonScreen component is now properly integrated into the navigation system using Expo Router.

## Navigation Flow

1. **Home Screen** → User taps on a skill in the SkillTree
2. **SkillModal** → Shows skill details and "Start Learning" button
3. **LessonScreen** → Full-screen lesson experience with step-by-step progression

## Files Created/Modified

### 1. `app/lesson-screen.tsx` (NEW)
- Route handler for the lesson screen
- Parses skill data from navigation parameters
- Handles navigation back to previous screen
- Includes debug logging for troubleshooting

### 2. `components/modals/SkillModal.tsx` (MODIFIED)
- Removed inline LessonScreen rendering
- Added proper navigation to `/lesson-screen` route
- Passes skill data as route parameters

### 3. `components/LessonScreen.tsx` (MODIFIED)
- Added SafeAreaView for proper full-screen display
- Added Android back button handling
- Fixed background color (removed red debug color)
- Enhanced with proper navigation integration

## How It Works

### Navigation Parameters
When navigating to the lesson screen, the following parameters are passed:

```typescript
{
  skillId: string,
  skillTitle: string,
  skillDescription: string,
  skillIcon: string,
  skillColor: string,
  skillLevel: string,
  skillXpReward: string,
  skillCategory: string,
  skillPrerequisites: string, // JSON stringified
  skillMicroSteps: string,    // JSON stringified
  skillIsUnlocked: string,
  skillIsCompleted: string,
  skillProgress: string,
  skillCrowns: string,
  skillLessons: string
}
```

### Lesson Screen Features
- **Step-by-step progression** through micro-steps
- **Interactive quizzes** with scoring
- **Progress tracking** with visual progress bar
- **Real-time Firebase sync** for progress saving
- **Android back button** support
- **Safe area** handling for different screen sizes

## Testing the Navigation

1. **Start the app** and navigate to the home screen
2. **Tap on any skill** in the SkillTree
3. **Tap "Start Learning"** in the skill modal
4. **Verify** that the lesson screen opens with the skill data
5. **Test navigation** by tapping the back button or completing lessons

## Debug Information

The lesson screen route includes console logging to help debug navigation issues:

```javascript
console.log('LessonScreenRoute - Received params:', params);
console.log('LessonScreenRoute - Parsed skill:', skill);
```

Check the console for these logs when testing navigation.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Navigation not working**: Check that the route path is correct (`/lesson-screen`)
2. **Skill data missing**: Verify that all required parameters are being passed
3. **Screen not full-screen**: Ensure SafeAreaView is properly implemented
4. **Back button not working**: Check that BackHandler is properly set up

### Debug Steps:

1. Check console logs for parameter passing
2. Verify skill data is properly parsed
3. Test navigation with different skills
4. Check for any TypeScript errors

## Future Enhancements

- Add loading states during navigation
- Implement deep linking for specific lessons
- Add navigation breadcrumbs
- Implement lesson bookmarking
- Add offline lesson support

The lesson screen is now fully integrated into the navigation system and ready for use!
